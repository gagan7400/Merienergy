                                    personal data are transmitted, as well as when the newsletter is ordered from the

                                <p>Meri Energy AG informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of a
                                    newsletter about enterprise offers. The enterprise's newsletter may only be received
                                    by the data subject if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the
                                    data subject registers for the newsletter shipping.</p>
                                <p>A confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address registered by a data subject
                                    for the first time for newsletter shipping, for legal reasons, in a double opt-in
                                    procedure. This confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the owner of the e-mail

                                <p>During the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the

                                    subject at the time of the registration, as well as the date and time of the
                                    registration. The collection of this data is necessary in order to understand the
                                    (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a later date, and it
                                    therefore serves the aim of the legal protection of the controller.</p>
                                <p>The personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only be

                                    service or a registration in question, as this could be the case in the event of
                                    modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the event of a change in technical
