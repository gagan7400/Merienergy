                                    A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string

                                    our enterprise’s newsletter. The input mask used for this purpose determines what
                                    personal data are transmitted, as well as when the newsletter is ordered from the
                                    controller.</p>


                                <p> The Meri Energy AG informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of
                                    a newsletter about enterprise offers. The enterprise’s newsletter may only be
                                    received by the data subject if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and
                                    (2) the data subject registers for the newsletter shipping. A confirmation e-mail
                                    will be sent to the e-mail address registered by a data subject for the first time
                                    for newsletter shipping, for legal reasons, in the double opt-in procedure. This
                                    confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the owner of the e-mail address as the
                                    data subject is authorized to receive the newsletter.</p>

                                <p> During the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the
                                    computer system assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data
                                    subject at the time of the registration, as well as the date and time of the
                                    registration. The collection of this data is necessary in order to understand the
                                    (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a later date, and it
                                    therefore serves the aim of the legal protection of the controller.</p>

                                <p> The personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only
                                    be used to send our newsletter. In addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be
                                    informed by e-mail, as long as this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter
                                    service or a registration in question, as this could be the case in the event of
                                    modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the event of a change in technical
                                    circumstances. There will be no transfer of personal data collected by the
                                    newsletter service to third parties. The subscription to our newsletter may be
                                    terminated by the data subject at any time. The consent to the storage of personal
                                    data, which the data subject has given for shipping the newsletter, may be revoked
                                    at any time. For the purpose of revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found
                                    in each newsletter. It is also possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any
                                    time directly on the website of the controller, or to communicate this to the
                                    controller in a different way.</p>

                                <p>The newsletter of the Meri Energy AG contains so-called tracking pixels. A tracking
                                    pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format
                                    to enable log file recording and analysis. This allows a statistical analysis of the
                                    success or failure of online marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded tracking
                                    pixel, the Meri Energy AG may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a data
                                    subject, and which links in the e-mail were called up by data subjects.</p>

                                <p> Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are
                                    stored and analyzed by the controller in order to optimize the shipping of the
                                    newsletter, as well as to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to the
                                    interests of the data subject. These personal data will not be passed on to third
                                    parties. Data subjects are at any time entitled to revoke the respective separate
                                    declaration of consent issued by means of the double-opt-in procedure. After a
                                    revocation, these personal data will be deleted by the controller. The Meri Energy
                                    AG automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a
                                    revocation.</p>
